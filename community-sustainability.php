                            The Renand Foundation provides free basic
                            healthcare to children and their families in
                            the Jacmel region. For thousands of people
                            living in the community, our health services
                            are their only option either because of lack
                            of access or because of poverty. Over the
                            past five years, doctors and nurses working
                            with the Foundation have examined and
                            treated over {number} patients.

                            The Renand Foundation has responded
                            to changing circumstances by making its
                            healthcare services more accessible.

                            conditions requiring specialized expertise, routine dental care, HIV education,

                            The Renand Foundation builds better lives for families in the community, thus ensuring

                            The Renand Foundation provides employment. The Foundation employs, for example,
                            teachers, cooks, doctors and nurses, construction works, and administrative staff,
                            helping to build the local economy.

                            The Foundationâ€™s agriculture training program
                            teaches farmers modern methods to grow
                            nutritious crops using sustainable techniques.
                            Because the Foundation purchases food
                            for our student lunches from local vendors
                            and farmers, we support the livelihood of
                            the community.

                            Since its inception, the Foundation has built
                            or restored dozens of houses for families
                            without any livable shelter. The
                            two-room, reinforced concrete block homes
                            built by the Foundation provide a secure
                            environment and safe refuge from storms.
