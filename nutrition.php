                            Haiti is the only country in the Americas with
                            an adult literacy rate of less than 50 percent,
                            and a youth literacy rate of less than
                            80 percent. The Haitian educational system is
                            ranked 177th out of 186 globally in terms of national
                            spending on education. Consequently, there are
                            no public schools in almost all of Haiti.
                            Around 90% of schools in Haiti are privately run,
                            mostly by for-profit organizations or by religious
                            institutions, which charge tuition. More than half
                            of Haiti's population lives below the international
                            poverty line of $1.25 per day, so it's very difficult

                            Foundation leadership works with our cooks at each school and after-school center to
                            ensure that the meals are nutritionally balanced.  The meal typically includes rice or
                            noodles topped with a portion of meat, sauce, a vegetable and fruit, accompanied
                            by a fruit drink.

                            The Renand Foundation supports the local
                            economy by sourcing much of its fresh fruit
                            and vegetables from the local marketplace.
                            The ingredients that cannot be obtained from
                            local farmers are purchased from area suppliers
                            to ensure that all
                            purchases support
                            the local economy.
