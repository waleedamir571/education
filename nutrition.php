                            When a child is hungry, 
                            their focus is on eating, not 
                            learning. Because of 
                            pervasive poverty,  children 
                            in Haiti often eat only every 
                            other day.  To help build 
                            happier, healthier students, 
                            the Renand Foundation 
                            provides each child attending 
                            one of its educational 
                            programs with a daily meal.  
                            Due to the generosity of our 
                            sponsors, our students are 
                            not distracted by hunger.

                            Foundation leadership works with our cooks at each school and after-school center to
                            ensure that the meals are nutritionally balanced.  The meal typically includes rice or
                            noodles topped with a portion of meat, sauce, a vegetable and fruit, accompanied
                            by a fruit drink.

                            The Renand Foundation supports the local
                            economy by sourcing much of its fresh fruit
                            and vegetables from the local marketplace.
                            The ingredients that cannot be obtained from
                            local farmers are purchased from area suppliers
                            to ensure that all
                            purchases support
                            the local economy.

                            teachers, plant and cultivate vegetables on school
