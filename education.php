                            Haiti is the only country in the Americas with
                            an adult literacy rate of less than 50 percent,
                            and a youth literacy rate of less than
                            80 percent. The Haitian educational system is
                            ranked 177th out of 186 globally in terms of national
                            spending on education. Consequently, there are
                            no public schools in almost all of Haiti.
                            Around 90% of schools in Haiti are privately run,
                            mostly by for-profit organizations or by religious
                            institutions, which charge tuition. More than half
                            of Haiti's population lives below the international
                            poverty line of $1.25 per day, so it's very difficult

                            Poor families unable to pay for a child’s well-being and education are more likely to give
                            their child to another family, often in a larger city, where they serve as Restaveks,
                            functioning largely as a child slave.

                            Providing some of the poorest Haitian children access to education is a primary focus of
                            the Renand Foundation. The Foundation operates two elementary schools in the Jacmel
                            region — Chapman Wilson Academy in Bassin Bleu, and Snyder Jones Academy in Lamandou.
                            Each of the schools provide classes for kindergarten through 6th grade. Through the generous
                            support of donors to the Renand Foundation, tuition, uniforms, books and other school
                            supplies are provided free to the students attending both Chapman Wilson Academy and
                            Snyder Jones Academy.

                            The Foundation also provides “After School” 
                            tutoring programs in nearby villages, including
                            The Violet C. Green Center in Marbial, The

                            Tuition, books and school supplies are
                            also provided to the students studying

                            Nearly 75 percent of Haitian households have no
                            access to electricity, especially outside of the capital region. Thanks to donor generosity, 
                            each of the Renand Foundation educational programs are solar powered, providing

                            Students come to our schools speaking Creole, which is most often spoken at 
                            home. At school they are taught French, the national language of Haiti, as well as
                            English to maximize their future opportunities. Students also learn math, reading, writing,
                            and computer skills.
